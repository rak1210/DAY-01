	--> Objects are important data types in javascript. Objects are different than primitive datatypes (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.). Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
	
	--> Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each

	--> Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types. An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.

	--> Internally, JavaScript engines use various data structures to represent objects efficiently. One common approach is using a hash table or a similar structure to store the object’s properties and their corresponding values. This allows for fast access and manipulation of properties.

	--> Internally, JavaScript engines implement objects using various data structures, with one of the most common being a hash table (or dictionary). A hash table allows for constant-time access to values based on their keys, making it efficient for property lookup and manipulation.
